# Postgres Skills

A collection of [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io/) for Postgres, curated from practitioners with years of real-world experience building and scaling applications on Postgres.

## Goal

Give every AI engineer instant access to the wisdom of a staff engineer who has seen what works and what fails in production Postgres. Once installed, these skills guide your agent toward proven patterns and away from common mistakes.

## What are Agent Skills?

Skills are folders of instructions, scripts, and resources that agents can discover and use to perform tasks more accurately. Once installed, skills are automatically invoked when the agent detects relevant tasks.

Each skill starts with a `SKILL.md` file that serves as the entry point, allowing agents to progressively discover more detail as needed.

## AI Policy

Skills must be written by humans. AI-generated content defeats the purpose: if the information can be generated by an AI on demand, there is no value in encoding it into a skill ahead of time.

The value of a skill comes from human judgment, accumulated experience, and insight that AI does not already have. That is what makes it worth installing.

AI tools may be used for reviewing and testing skill content, but not for authoring it.
